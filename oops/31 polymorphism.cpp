// polymorphism
// poly - many  , morph - forms
// simple polymorphism means existing in many forms

// Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It allows you to write code that can work with different types of objects in a generic way.

// For example, let's say we have a base class called Animal and derived classes called Dog and Cat. The Animal class has a function called makeSound(), and each derived class overrides this function with its own implementation.

// With polymorphism, you can create objects of type Dog and Cat but treat them as objects of type Animal. This means you can call the makeSound() function on an Animal pointer, and the appropriate implementation based on the actual object type will be executed.

// there are two type of polymorphism
// 1) Compile time polymorphism
// 2) Run time polymorphism

// 1) Compile time polymorphism

// In compile time polymorphism there are two types again 
// i) function overloading
// ii) operator overloading
